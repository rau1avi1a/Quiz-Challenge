To begin the test, click the "START" button. Immediately after, the first question will pop up (note that during this time the "View Highscores" button is disabled). Upon clicking on an answer, the next question will pop up. The time limit is set to 120 seconds and answering incorrectly will cost 20 seconds. The test will end either when the user finishes the questions, or when the timer runs out. Upon finishing the test, a screen will show where the user can enter their initials to save their score. After submiting the score, all saved scores will appear and the "Go Back" button will show. Clicking the "Go Back" button will take the user back to the start menu where they can choose to take it again.
